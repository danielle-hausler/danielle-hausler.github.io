Some research projects that I've worked on during my Msc studies

#### 1) Incorporating Active learning Methods with Contextualized Sentence Representations

As part of NLP course and together with Uri Katz, we investigated the relation between contextual text representations (Average BERT and Sentence BERT) and the effectiveness of the active learning procedure. Our empirical staudy revealed a relation between the representation type and the AL performance, based on the representation ability to separate classes.

More details could be found in the project's [paper](https://github.com/danielle-hausler/Incorporating_Active_learning_Methods_with_Contextualized_Sentence_Representations.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/daniellehausler/nlp_active_learning).
